# pytorch-progression
Worked examples of PyTorch from linear regression to transformers, with a focus on NLP tasks.

Plan:
* Linear regression with plain PyTorch
* Linear regression with PyTorch Ignite
* Logistic regression
* Simple Neural Networks
* Word2Vec
* Deep Neural Network
* Common tricks for training DNNs
  * Dropout
  * BatchNorm, LayerNorm
  * Early Stopping
* Recurrent Neural Networks
* RNNs + attention: LSTMs/GRUs
* Stacking and BiDirectional
* Seq2Seq
* Transformers
* Transfer learning with transformers
